# Origins Remade
Made off of the framework by Monokiro. 

Wishes to expand on some of the ideas he began the project with.

# NOTICE:
Visuals WILL be neglected for the early part of this mod. I am sorry. I'm not a fan of this situation either.

# Indev Checklist:
 - Fix bugs from the base mod.
 - Reorganize Tech Tree around three branches of development linked to the Policy Trees
 - Reorganize Policy Trees around the existing framework: Adaptation(Tradition), Materialism(Innovation), and Spiritualism(Mysticism).
 - Alter the "Tribe"(Settler) unit and Hunter Unit to fit the new vision
 - Add one new Barbarian Unit
